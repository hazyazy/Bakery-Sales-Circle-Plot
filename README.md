## Conclusion
This interactive visual allows the bakery manager to plan ahead what items are most likely to sell on a given day and time.
for example, it shows that from the hour of 7:15 to 13:00, Traditional Baguette is the most in demand item. However, the Sales of Coupe only picks up at 9:45 to 12:15 which happenes to be when the Bakery Sales peak as well.
